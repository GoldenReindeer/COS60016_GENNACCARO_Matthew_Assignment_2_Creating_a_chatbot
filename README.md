# Django weather services. 

COS60016_GENNACCARO_Matthew_Assignment_2_Creating_a_chatbot 

Welcome to Django weather services!
This is a web application created using Python and the Django framework. 
It contains a weather app to get weather information through an API when provided with latitude and longitude coordinates.
Additionally, there is a chatbot called Jarvis, who can talk to users and answer some basic questions, as well as query the API for weather information when prompted.

Installation: 
Simply copying the entire project into a PyCharm (or other Python IDE) project and then making sure to install everything in requirements.txt via pip commands 
should be sufficient to ensure the app works correctly. Once this is done, navigate to the "A_Django_Project" directory in the terminal using the command 
"cd A_Django_Project". Then use the command "python manage.py runserver" to initiate the server. Click the provided link in the terminal or put the URL into 
a web browser. 

Usage: 
From here, you can interact with the page as you would any website. Click on "Weather app" to use the weather application. Click on "Chatbot" to 
use the chatbot and have a conversation with Jarvis.
